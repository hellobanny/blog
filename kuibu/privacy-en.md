What Personal Data will we collect and for which purposes do we collect and process it?

When you chose to interact with us through Kuibu, we will collect data relating to your sleeping habits and walk step which may also include Personal Data related to you. Other than what is specifically provided in this Privacy Policy, we will not share this information or HealthKit Data with any third party. Personal Data and HealthKit Data will not be used for marketing/advertising purposes and will only be accessed by you in connection with your use of Kuibu.

We will only use the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and for the purposes of analysing and presenting end user’s sleep time and walk step on an aggregated level as well as a tool for continuously updating and developing the Kuibu service.

If you provide Personal Data for a specific reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we may use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem.

We may communicate with you through email and notices posted via Kuibu. These communications may include a series of welcome emails which help inform you about various features of Kuibu. Please be aware that you may receive certain emails from us related to the proper functioning of your account.

##Cookies:
In providing Kuibu, we may use cookies. A cookie is a piece of information that the computer or computers that host our services give to your browser when you access Kuibu. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to Kuibu and help us analyse usage of Kuibu more accurately. For instance, our services may set a cookie on your browser that keeps you from needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the site. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of Kuibu features.
