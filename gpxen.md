#GPX Builder
##Why?
[Fog of World](www.fogofworld.com) is a cool app that record everywhere you have been in your whole life. But it will dramatically decrease battery life while recording, and can’t record the place you have been before using that app. It’s really a pity. But if you have this app, you can draw the place you have been and export them to GPX files, then import to Fog of World.
